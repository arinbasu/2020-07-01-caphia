author: Arindam Basu
tags: lecture, carpentries, epidemiology
---

## What this short workshop will cover

- Intro to Epidemiology teaching
- My experience with Carpentries
- Porting the Carpentries as a teaching philosophy to teaching public health
- Epidemiology as a test case

---

## Opinionated look at teaching Epidemiology
- Distribution
- Determinants of diseases
- Use of information for disease prevention and health promotion
- Students should learn applied skills
---
## What aspects work well on didactic classrooms
- Theory of Epidemiology
- Principles of Epidemic investigation 
- Principles of Epidemic modelling
- Principles of Internal validity 
- Principles of Causal Inference
- Theories of counterfactuals
---

## Suitable for discursive classrooms and problem solving
- Discussion of Exemplars (John Snow, James Lind)
- Discussion of DAGs and SWIGs in counterfactual theories of causation
- Debating Epidemiological Study designs
- Critical appraisal of epidemiological studies using GRADE approach
- Drafting of exposure assessment using questionnaires (social epidemiology)
---

## Examples: Hands-on
- Standardised mortality/morbidity/prevalence
- Stratified analysis of two by two tables
- Calculation of Absolute Risk, Relative Risk, PAR% etc
- Sample size estimation and power calculation
- Hands on analysis of epidemiological data analysis using Epi Info/Stata/R
---

## The Carpentries model
- From novices to competent practitioners
- Focused on mental models
- Guided instructions
- Livecoding
- Feedbacks
- Formative Assessments

---

## Novices to competent practitioners
| Action/Content | Does not Know | Knows                  |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Does not know  | Novice        | Competent practitioner |
| Knows          | Expert        | Master                 |

---

## Examples of novice Epidemiologist?
- Cannot do steps of epidemic investigation
- Familiar with theory but cannot frame research questions
- Cannot decide which study designs are appropriate

---

## Mental models

## Mental model of a novice

## Mental model of the expert

---

## Theory of mental models
- Novices start with unconnected facts
- Novices have trouble connecting facts
- Competent practitioners connect facts from A to B, 
- Competent practitioners need heuristics and practice
- Experts and Masters operate in a state of flow
- Experts have blind spots where what is obvious are steps shifted to subliminal

---

## Mental models of typical entry level students in our courses
- May have crammed a lot of facts about biology and health in previous courses
- When asked can tell us a lot about isolated facts
- Cannot connect isolated pieces of information
- Challenge: move them to the stage of competent practice
- Helps: Repeated spaced hands-on activities

---

## Competent epidemiology practitioners
- Given a problem, can set up an action plan
- Assess studies and existing situation
- Read and interpret graphs,
- Set up models 
- Rapidly collect data and match with the extant models
- Take action and put together teams
- Knows when to take action in face of sparse data

---

## Mapping Dreyfus models to teaching Epidemiology
- Provide practice opportunities
- Allow for guided practice
- Teacher models and shows how to
- Students repeat after the teachers
- Discussion takes place with the conscious practice 

---

## Guided instructions
- Teacher sets up the scaffold
- Teacher models the solution step by step
- Students follow through
- Teacher then provides formative assessments 
- Teacher provides feedbacks
- Students solve problems in pairs

---

## Work in pairs: peer instructions
- One student works on the computer
- Another student helps her
- Then they take turns
- This helps real time collaboration
- Pair up advanced students with relatively novices

---

## Live coding and deliberate practice
- Teacher selects a problem
- Teacher presents the problem
- Teacher works on the computer to solve it
- Students follows the teacher to work on the computer
- Question, answer, explanations
- Slow pace, one topic at a time

---

## Aim: move novices to competent practitioners
- Start with guided instructions
- Present with different challanges
- Let the students work out 
- Provide feedbacks
- Each challenge should build on the others

---

## Practice with different problems with some guidance
- Show how to calculate standardised rates
- Provide new data sets
- Ask the students to work out on their own
- Discuss the assignment

---

## Example of guided instructions:
- Calculation of standardised prevalence

---

## Live coding in practice at UC: steps of calculating standardised prevalence
- Tell them the steps:
- First step: enter the age-specific prevalence
- Second step: enter the SEGI world population
- Third step: multiply the age-specific prevalence with the SEGI numbers 
- Fourth step: Add up the numbers in SEGI population

---

---

## Interact and take questions from students
- Respond to students' questions
- Each student sticks sticky notes on the back of their computers
- This is done so that they do not have to remove their hands while working
- Teacher stops to answer questions

---

## Formative assessments using Multiple choice questions
- Prepare multiple choice questions in advance
- Stop and ask these questions before proceeding to each next step
- One or two multiple choice questions to clarify and test high impact topics
- Everyone should undestand before moving to the next step
- One formative assessment every 10-20 minutes of class

---

## Formative assessments using faded examples
- Use collaborative documents for this
- Google Docs, Hackmd (we use this)
- Write the steps 
- Ask the students to fill in

---

## End of class feedbacks from students

## Lessons learned
- Plan early
- Explain
- Group students in pairs
- Teach in pairs

---

## Next steps
- Arrange a formal evaluation of the style
- It is possible to teach Epidemiological methods using the Carpentries style
